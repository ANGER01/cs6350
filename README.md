To use the Decision Tree in the DecisionTree folder you need to import the DecisionTree class from decision_tree.py
When creating the object you only need the max depth as an input
You then call fit to build the tree and you give it training data with the features and labels seperated into two arrays and you give the function you want to use to split the data
The only options for the functions at this point is Entropy, Majority Error, and Gini Index
You can then use the tree with the predict function by giving it any non-labeled data

--PERCEPTRON--
To run the perceptron algorithms, you can use the perceptron.py file. You need all the required dependencies
and you need to run it from inside the perceptron folder. From there you can either run python perceptron.py or hit the run button in your IDE of choice.


--SVM--
To run svm.py first go to the svm directory and input python svm.py into the terminal and that is all you need to do
to run the dual svm and kernel_svm you need to go to the SVM directory and run python dual_svm.py
